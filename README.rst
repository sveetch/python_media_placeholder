=====================================
Making dummy unique media with Python
=====================================

This is a collection of basic Python scripts to build dummy media, each created media
will be a unique file that should be almost guaranteed against any checksum or basic
media parsing validation.

It involves Pillow requirement for images and FFmpeg with a Python wrapper for videos.

This project is more like a working Proof & Concept than anything else, don't expect
script just working out of the box with a lot of options.

Install
-------

Just use: ::

    make install

This will just install the requirements.

Usage
-----

Just open the script files and modify them for your purpose then you will be able to
run them.
